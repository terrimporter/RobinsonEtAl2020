# README

This repository contains the dataflow and scripts used to process the COI metabarcode reads in the paper Robinson et al., 2020 (submitted).

Infiles and scripts can be downloaded from https://github.com/terrimporter/RobinsonEtAl2020/releases .

## Infiles

cat.csv contains the ESV ids, sample names, and taxonomic assignments.  

## R Scripts

Fig 1 ESV richness.  Uses cat.csv

Fig 2 NMDS plots.  Uses cat.csv

Fig 3 Venn diagrams.

Fig 4 Ethanol vs Antifreeze xy-plot showing orders and genera.  Uses cat.csv

Fig 5 Ethanol vs Antifreeze EPT family heatmaps.  Uses cat.csv

## Supplementary data files

1. Denoised, chimera-filtered ESVs (FASTA) for BR5, F230R, and ml-jg.  

2. Denoised, chimera-filtered ESVs, pseudogene-filtered ORFs (FASTA) for BR5, F230R, and ml-jg.

3. ESV x sample tables for BR5, F230R, and ml-jg.  These are based on the denoised, chimera-, and pseudogene-filtered ESVs.
