# README

This repository contains the dataflow and scripts used to process the COI metabarcode reads in the paper Robinson et al., 2020 (in prep).

Infiles and scripts can be downloaded from https://github.com/terrimporter/RobinsonEtAl2020/releases .

## Infiles

cat.csv contains the ESV ids, sample names, and taxonomic assignments.  

## R Scripts
